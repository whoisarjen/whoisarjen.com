## The Mystery: Why Was My Vercel Bill Exploding?

I took over a Nuxt 3 project from another developer and deployed it to production as the deadline was already there. Within days, **Vercel bandwidth costs exceeded $50/day**.

The only clue? The bundle size was _massive_.

After some digging, I found the root cause:  
**Font Awesome was imported with a wildcard, pulling in every single icon in the library**.

## The Problem I Inherited

The original setup looked like this:

```js
import { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core'
import { fas } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'

library.add(fas)
```

Itâ€™s convenient â€” you instantly get every solid icon.
But this also means **hundreds of unused icons** are shipped to every user, adding megabytes of unnecessary SVG data to the bundle.

## The Fix: Import Only What You Need

I replaced the wildcard import with explicit imports for only the icons used in the app.

```js
import { library, config } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core'
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/vue-fontawesome'

// âœ… Only specific icons
import { faHeart } from '@fortawesome/pro-light-svg-icons'
import { faCheck } from '@fortawesome/pro-solid-svg-icons'

config.autoAddCss = false
library.add(faHeart, faCheck)

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.vueApp.component('font-awesome-icon', FontAwesomeIcon)
})
```

## The Results

- **Bundle size dropped dramatically**
- **Transfer usage returned to normal**
- Daily costs went from **\$50 â†’ \$1**
- Page load performance improved significantly

## Lessons Learned

1. If you inherit a project, **audit third-party imports** early.
2. **Never import entire icon packs** unless you actually need them.
3. Use bundle analyzers (`nuxt build --analyze`) to spot bloated dependencies before they hit production.

ðŸ’¡ A single `import *` can quietly burn through your CDN budget â€” especially if itâ€™s pulling in a whole library.
