## The Discovery: An Unexpected Spike in Bandwidth

The other day, I was optimizing a Nuxt 3 project I inherited—and noticed weird spikes in “Fast Data Transfer” on Vercel. The app wasn’t doing anything heavy, yet the network usage seemed excessive.

One clue stood out: **every internal link was preloading content the moment it entered the viewport**.

Turns out, Nuxt’s `nuxt-link` prefetch feature was preloading numerous chunks—turning simple page navigation into a bandwidth-hungry process :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## What I Found: Prefetching Isn't Free

By default, Nuxt enables **smart prefetching**—that means when a `<nuxt-link>` appears on screen, it automatically fetches that page’s code. It uses `IntersectionObserver` and `requestIdleCallback`, which is clever—but in larger apps with many links, it leads to a flood of unnecessary network requests :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

This accidental behavior meant users triggered dozens of page fetches just by scrolling. All that ended up on my Vercel bill.

## The Fix: Disable Prefetch Globally

I needed a quick and effective way to stop it. A look at the docs revealed we can disable prefetch across the board in `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  experimental: {
    defaults: {
      nuxtLink: {
        prefetch: false,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

Or, more simply:

```js
export default {
  router: {
    prefetchLinks: false,
  },
}
```

Both methods prevent Nuxt from injecting `<link rel="prefetch">` tags for page chunks ([Nuxt][1], [Medium][2]).

## Results: Faster, Leaner, and Cheaper

- **Bandwidth usage dropped significantly**
- **Vercel “Fast Data Transfer” costs normalized**
- **Page performance stayed fast—without wasted fetches**
- **More control over what actually gets prefetched**

## Lessons Learned

1. Inherited defaults—especially features like smart prefetch—can stealthily drain bandwidth.
2. Nuxt gives you control—disable prefetch globally when you value budget over ultra-aggressive navigation performance.
3. For high-link-volume pages, disable by default and **opt-in manually** on critical links.
4. Vercel’s cost dashboard helped me trace the issue fast—a crucial part of the optimization process.
